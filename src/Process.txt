Assumptions -

1. Strings will not have "," char in them.
2. if the precision is greater than 3 digit, we will only consider the first three digits. example - 0.0045 => 0.004. git


Algorithm -

1. Convert probabilities to Integer by multiplying by a common factor.

example - prob [0.4,0.36,0.9], string =["a","b","c"]
 ==> multiply by 100 ==> [40,36,9]

2.Then create an array list and add idx value the probabilities number of times times.

Like for above example - [0,0,0,0,0,......0(40 times),1,1,1,..1(36 times),2,2,2...2(9 times) ] (this has the same
distribution as of the original probabilities)

Then find a random number between (0, len(arr)-1) and use the value at this index as the index of the string array
